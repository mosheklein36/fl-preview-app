Build a mobile-first Android app called **FL Preview**. The purpose of this app is to let me instantly listen to the latest audio previews of my FL Studio projects. These previews are automatically rendered on my computer by a PowerShell script and uploaded to Firebase Storage. The app must fetch, display, and play these previews cleanly and reliably.

---------------------------------------
APP PURPOSE
---------------------------------------
The app does NOT need to open or interpret .flp files. It only needs to read:
1. MP3 preview files uploaded by my auto-render script.
2. JSON metadata files that describe each preview.

Each render produces:
- An MP3 file: `<projectName>-<timestamp>.mp3`
- A JSON metadata file: `<projectName>-<timestamp>.json`

Example metadata JSON:
{
  "project": "DrillBeat01",
  "timestamp": "20260105_124500",
  "filename": "DrillBeat01-20260105_124500.mp3"
}

The app must read these metadata files from Firebase Storage, sort them, and display them in a clean UI.
